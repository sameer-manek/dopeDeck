#About

A perfect default home page for your browsers if you want fast access to your projects on localhost while also need functionalities such as google search, quick links, etc. Also it is pre-designed to work and easy to setup!

Enjoy :D

## How To

1. Copy `index.php` and `index-custom-style.css` in the root directory of localhost (e.g. `username/sites`)
2. Create a folder for each category (e.g. `username/sites/workspace` and `username/sites/personal`)
3. Rename `dir-index.php` to `index.php` and copy it once into every folder you created
4. Open each `index.php` and apply the `active`-class to the current folder/category
5. Open `index.php` in the root directory and change the redirect link to the folder/category of your choice
6. Change and add links to the sidebar as you like

## Notes

* The `vHost`-button only works if you create a virtual host with the same name as the repository
* The project list always displays the last modified project/folder first
